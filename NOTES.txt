To do
=====

CPU:
- better lr handling (blr would be nice)
- fix condition code handling on ldw/ldb - having to ld+cmp is annoying
- add/sub short immediate
- move SPR instructions from 5xxx to Fxxx?


BUILD:
- filter VTEST to only run testbenches so that I can move cozy_memory_sim out of VSOURCE


VGA:
- cursor (and cursor color)
- border color
- soft scroll

- Store these values in unused video memory and read it during vblank?
